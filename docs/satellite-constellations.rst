Satelilte Constellations
########################

The ``rubin_sim.satellite_constellations`` module contains
tools for creating and propgating satellite mega constellations
to evaluate how they could streak Rubin images.
There is also an extension for ``rubin_scheduler`` that will add
"satellite dodging" to the scheduler logic, at a cost of overall image depth.
